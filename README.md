This Arduino code controls three LEDs—red, yellow, and green—using a joystick as the input device. The program continuously reads the joystick’s X-axis and Y-axis analog values to detect the direction in which the joystick is being pushed. When the joystick is pushed downward, the red LED turns on; when pushed upward, the green LED turns on; and when pushed to the left, the yellow LED turns on. If the joystick is centered or pushed to the right, all LEDs remain off. By comparing the joystick’s analog readings to threshold values, the code determines the direction and activates the appropriate LED while ensuring the others are turned off. This allows the joystick to function as a simple directional controller for the LEDs.
